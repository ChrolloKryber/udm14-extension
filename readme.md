## UDM14 redirector

```diff
- Please note that this is still under development, I have not implemented the disable functionality button at the time of writing. The exstension works on basic google search page, it won't redirect you if you are in any other tab like images, shopping etc.

### What the heck is this udm14 anyways?

Internet as we've seen has come a long way.
And there's no denying that Google has established itself as a search engine monopoly. The google search engine as we see has evolved into a bloated mess.

On 15th May 2024, Google silently launched a new <strong><em><a href="https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1790473952256786805">Web</a></em></strong> mode to it's search engine. However in classic google manner, it is buried under multiple layers of menus. Thus, I decided to make it accessible to everyone by just creating this simple browser extension.
