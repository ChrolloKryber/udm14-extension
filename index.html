                    Internet as we've seen has come a long way.
                    And there's no denying that Google has established itself as a search engine monopoly. The google search engine as we see has evolved into a bloated mess.

However in classic google manner, it is buried under multiple layers of menus. Thus, I decided to make it accessible to everyone by just creating this simple browser extension.
